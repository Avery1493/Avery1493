![Hey there, I'm Avery. I'm a data scientist. Check out my work.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Avery1493/Avery1493/main/bio.gif)
### I'm Avery Quinn. I'm a self-motivated and flexible data scientist adept at collecting, analyzing, interpreting large datasets, and developing forecasting models, with a strong attention to detail and significant ability to work in team environments.

Since high school, I had a strong desire to advise people about personal finance. After completing my Masters in Finance, 
I began working as a financial counselor. During that time, I discovered I really liked creating financial models to help others. 
That lead me to coding and learning more about computer science.
